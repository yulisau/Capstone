          <h2>What is ASMR?</h2>
          <p>
            ASMR is an acronym for autonomous sensory meridian response. Marriam
            Webster defines ASMR as "a
            <span style="font-weight: bold">pleasant tingling sensation</span>
            that originates on the back of the scalp and often spreads to the
            neck and upper spine, that occurs in some people in response to a
            stimulus (such as a particular kind of sound or movement), and that
            tends to have
            <span style="font-weight: bold">a calming effect</span>."
          </p>
          <p>
            In recent years, ASMR has gained more traction among people with
            different health problems like insomnia, anxiety, depression and
            PTSD. Videos are the most popular form of consuming ASMR and are
            available on a wide variety of platforms like youtube, instagram,
            tiktok, etc. ASMR videos usually focus on using different audio
            &#34;triggers&#34; which cause user's to experience calming tingling
            effects.

          <p>
            At regular graphic and audio speed, breathe in as the graphic
            expands, exhale as it shrinks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try other breathing technics like 4-7-8. This involves breathing in
            for 4 seconds, holding the breath for 7 seconds, and exhaling for 8
            seconds.
